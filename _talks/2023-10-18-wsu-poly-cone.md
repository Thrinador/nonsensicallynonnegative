## Abstract 

The set of polynomials that preserve nonnegative matrices of a given order form a convex cone. In this talk, I will introduce some tools from convex analysis and nonnegative matrix theory. Then apply those tools to study this cone and present recent findings that the cone is not-polyhedral even when the degree of the polynomials is fixed to twice the size of the matrices.
