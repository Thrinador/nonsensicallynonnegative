## Abstract 

In further pursuit of a solution to the celebrated nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem, Loewy and London [Linear and Multilinear Algebra 6 (1978/79), no.~1, 83--90] posed the problem of characterizing all polynomials that preserve all nonnegative matrices of a fixed order. If $\mathscr{P}_n$ denotes the set of all polynomials that preserve all $n$-by-$n$ nonnegative matrices, then it is clear that polynomials with nonnegative coefficients belong to $\mathscr{P}_n$. However, it is known that $\mathscr{P}_n$ contains polynomials with negative entries. In this presentation, results for $\mathscr{P}_n$ with respect to the coefficients of the polynomials belonging to $\mathscr{P}_n$. Along the way, a generalization for the even and odd parts of a polynomial are given. This talk concludes with a characterization of $\mathscr{P}_2$.
