My research is focused on polynomials and nonnegative matrices, with a special interest in the symmetric nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem. Below are two plots for the numerically generated feasibility region for 4x4 doubly stochastic symmetric matrices and two plots for the 5x5 region. Note that the problem is still open in proving what this region looks like.
