One of the difficult things about the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP), is trying to reason about the matrices that lie on the boundary. This project aims to numerically solve for these matrices using a series of optimization steps. The idea is that once these matrices are found we can build conjectures on what the boundary of the NIEP looks like.

The optimization is done by running differential evolution on the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of matrices. Once a given coefficient has been solved for, that is we have a feasible range, it is used as a constraint for the next coefficient. This process will produce a grid search like output of the feasible region for the coefficients. The matrices on the boundary of this region are then the matrices on the boundary of the NIEP.

This project gave me a deeper understanding of the inner workings of python and the numpy, scipy libraries.
